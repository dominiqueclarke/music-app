Winner, "Best Design", DevMountain personal projects. 

Lalela is live music discovery app with built in music previews. It's a full stack application built with Angular 1, Node, Express, MongoDB and Mapbox. 

Lalela pulls data from two RESTful APIs to gather upcoming events in your area and pair them with short previews of each artist's music.
